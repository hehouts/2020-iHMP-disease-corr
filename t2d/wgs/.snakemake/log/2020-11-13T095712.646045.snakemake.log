Error: Directory cannot be locked. Please make sure that no other Snakemake process is trying to create the same files in the following directory:
/home/hehouts/2020-iHMP-T2D
If you are sure that no other instances of snakemake are running on this directory, the remaining lock was likely caused by a kill signal or a power loss. It can be removed with the --unlock argument.
